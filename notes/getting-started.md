# Welcome to Your Notes!

This is a sample note to help you get started. You can create new notes by adding Markdown files to the `notes` directory.

## Structure

- **Create Folders**: Organize notes by creating folders for different sessions or topics.
- **Create Files**: Add `.md` files inside your folders.
- **Sub-Pages**: Create nested folders for even more granular organization.

The sidebar navigation will automatically update based on your file structure.

### Example

To create a note like this one, you would create a file at `notes/getting-started.md`.

To create a nested note, you could have a file at `notes/session-1/day-1-setup.md`.

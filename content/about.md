Results-driven Lead Cloud Security Engineer with experience in architecting and securing enterprise-scale cloud environments across AWS and Azure platforms. I specialize in implementing comprehensive security monitoring solutions, automating compliance frameworks, and designing robust cloud security architectures that protect critical business infrastructure.

Passionate about cloud security automation, incident response, and enforcing security-by-design principles. I've successfully led 15+ monthly incident investigations while maintaining 100% compliance with cybersecurity regulations, and implemented security controls aligned with NIST, CIS Benchmarks, and DISA STIGs across enterprise environments. My expertise spans SIEM, IDS/IPS, WAF, DLP systems, and infrastructure-as-code automation using Terraform and Ansible.

When I'm not securing cloud infrastructure, you'll find me exploring emerging security technologies, optimizing DevSecOps pipelines, or mentoring teams on cloud security best practices and compliance frameworks.

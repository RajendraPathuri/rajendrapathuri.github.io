Results-driven Cloud Security Engineer with 3+ years of experience securing multi-cloud environments across AWS, Azure, and GCP. I specialize in implementing zero-trust architectures, automating security controls, and designing scalable cloud security solutions. 

Passionate about DevSecOps, threat detection, and building secure-by-design systems. I've reduced security vulnerabilities by 65% through automated scanning and remediation pipelines, and I'm committed to making cloud infrastructure safer for everyone.

When I'm not securing cloud environments, you'll find me contributing to open-source security projects, participating in CTF competitions, or writing about cloud security best practices.

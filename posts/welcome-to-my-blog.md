## Welcome!

This is the very first post on my new blog, powered by Next.js and Markdown. I'm excited to have a space to share my thoughts on web development, technology, and everything in between.

### What to Expect

Here, you'll find a variety of content, including:

-   Tutorials and how-to guides
-   Deep dives into specific technologies
-   Thoughts on industry trends
-   Updates on my personal projects

I believe in learning in public, so this blog will be a chronicle of my journey as a developer.

```javascript
// Example code block
function greet(name) {
  console.log(`Hello, ${name}! Welcome to the blog.`);
}

greet('World');
```

Stay tuned for more content soon!

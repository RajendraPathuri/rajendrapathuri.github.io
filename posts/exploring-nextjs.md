## Why Next.js?

For a while now, Next.js has been my go-to framework for building React applications. Its combination of server-side rendering, static site generation, and powerful developer experience features makes it an incredibly versatile tool.

### Key Features I Love

1.  **App Router**: The new App Router with support for Server Components is a game-changer. It allows for more efficient data fetching and reduces the amount of JavaScript shipped to the client.
2.  **File-based Routing**: Simple and intuitive. Creating a new page is as easy as creating a new file.
3.  **Image Optimization**: The built-in `<Image>` component handles image optimization out of the box, which is crucial for web performance.

> Next.js gives you the best developer experience with all the features you need for production: hybrid static & server rendering, TypeScript support, smart bundling, route pre-fetching, and more. No config needed. - Vercel

If you haven't tried Next.js yet, I highly recommend giving it a spin for your next project. You won't be disappointed.
